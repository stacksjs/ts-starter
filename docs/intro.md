# A Better Developer Experience

> A TypeScript Starter Kit that will help you bootstrap your next project without minimal opinion.

# bun-ts-starter

This is an opinionated TypeScript Starter kit to help kick-start development of your next Bun package.

## Get Started

It's rather simple to get your package development started:

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
bunx degit stacksjs/ts-starter my-pkg
cd my-pkg

 # if you don't have pnpm installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`
bun i # install all deps
bun run build # builds the library for production-ready use

# after you have successfully committed, you may create a "release"
bun run release # automates git commits, versioning, and changelog generations
```

_Check out the package.json scripts for more commands._
